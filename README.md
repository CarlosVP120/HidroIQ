# HydroIQ

HydroIQ is a Python script that uses artificial intelligence to calculate the water quality index (WQI) and provide feedback to users. By analyzing data on various water quality parameters, including temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, and nutrient levels, HydroIQ can generate a numerical score that indicates the overall health of a body of water.

HydroIQ is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable. Users can specify which parameters to include in the WQI calculation and set custom thresholds for each parameter based on their specific needs. HydroIQ also includes a feedback mechanism that uses machine learning algorithms to suggest potential solutions for improving water quality based on past data.

## Features

- Calculates the water quality index (WQI) based on user-specified parameters and thresholds
- Provides feedback on potential causes of poor water quality using machine learning algorithms
- Highly customizable and configurable based on user needs
- Easy-to-use command line interface (CLI)

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-learn Python packages
- OpenAI API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository from GitHub:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hydroiq.git

2. Install the required Python packages using pip:
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn openai

3. Specify your OpenAI API key in the `hydroiq.py` file at the top:
import openai

openai.api_key = "YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

## Usage

To run HydroIQ, navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run the following command:
python hydroiq.py

You can customize the script by modifying the `config.json` file in the project directory. This file contains settings for the WQI calculation and feedback mechanism.
